#+title: Solid Notes

Building blocks
 1. Components
 2. Reactive Primites


** Components
functions that take props object and return JSX elements.
return only 1 jsx element.

** Reactive Primites
together they form auto-tracking sync engine (whats that?)
*** Siginal
conerstone of reactivity.
when it is changed solid automatically updates everything that uses it.
#+begin_src js

import { createSignal, createEffect, createMemo } from 'solid-js';
const [getCount, setCount] = creteSignal(0);

#+end_src

*derivied signals:*
functions that act like signals because they call a signal inside them.

*** Effects
observers that run when a signal variable changes.
#+begin_src js

import { createSignal, createEffect, createMemo } from 'solid-js';
createEffect(() => {
  // run code everytime a signal changes
})
#+end_src

*** Memos
cache values to save time, make it more efficient.
